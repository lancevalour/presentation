# What is it

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown):
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

[John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown):
> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Markdown is a tool to help you write better documentation.
